# Getting Started with Spring and Maven Guide

I've just followed the [Getting Started Guide](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mongodb/) to learn Spring and MongoDB

I've used Windows to do it, for the first time, so thats why my project is terrible, LOL
To install Maven in a Windows PC, you can follow [this tutorial](http://www.mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/)
And to install MongoDB just follow [this guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

I'm assuming that your computer already have the Java installed.

To run the application you need to run some commands.

First of all, install the project dependencies

```bash
mvn install
```

And to run the application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
